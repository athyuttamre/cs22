## Updating the Site

Feel free to edit any of the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files. Once you're done editing, commit to the Git repository. A post-commit hook will deploy the site to the public-facing version.

In essence, after editing any files and testing the site locally in your browser, use these commands from the top-level folder of the site.

```
git add -A
git commit -m "Add Homework 7"
```

That's it! The live version of the site can be found [here](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0220/).

## To-Do

- Make current TA hours dynamic ("Atty Eleti (aeleti) is holding hours right now in the Motorola Room.")
- Add new staff pictures
